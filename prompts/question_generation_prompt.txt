You are helping to build a benchmark for Sign Language Understanding (SLU)
based on written sentences that come from Sign Language Translation (SLT) outputs.

GOAL OF THIS BENCHMARK
======================

In SLT, automatic metrics like BLEU or ROUGE measure surface similarity,
but they do NOT tell us whether a translation is actually understandable
at the semantic level.

We want to test whether a sentence (a translation) still preserves enough
information for a human (or a model) to truly understand it.

We are especially interested in:
- whether the vocabulary and local content are rich enough to understand
  who is doing what, where, and with which objects (FACTUAL),
- whether temporal information (past vs present vs future, before vs after)
  is clearly preserved, not just isolated time words (TEMPORAL),
- whether logical relations such as causes, conditions, negations, and
  contrasts are explicit and meaningful (LOGICAL),
- whether the overall purpose or main idea of the sentence is clear (GLOBAL),
- whether the communicative intention (question, instruction, suggestion,
  expression of certainty/possibility) is preserved (PRAGMATIC).

Your task is to generate multiple-choice COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS that
directly probe these aspects.

We will use each question in two ways:
1) as a multiple-choice question (closed choice),
2) as an open-ended question, where an LLM judge evaluates a free answer.

Therefore, both the question and the options must really test
understanding of the sentence, not just trivial details.


HIGH-LEVEL TASK
===============

For each input sentence:

1) Decide which semantic SLU categories it meaningfully supports.
2) Generate 0–3 comprehension questions, with at most ONE question per category.
   Each question must be multiple-choice with:
   - 1 correct answer,
   - 4 plausible but incorrect distractors.

IMPORTANT BALANCE:
- For most contentful sentences, you SHOULD generate 1–2 questions.
- Use 0 questions only if the sentence is extremely short, phatic,
  or too vague (e.g., “Hi.”, “Thanks.”, “Okay.”).
- Prefer questions that test deeper understanding (temporal, logical,
  pragmatic, global) over trivial factual details when possible.


CATEGORIES
==========

You must use ONLY the following five categories:

- "temporal"
- "logical"
- "pragmatic"
- "factual"
- "global"

Each question MUST be labelled with exactly one of these categories.
At most ONE question per category per sentence.

Be aware that the same sentence may support different categories.
When this happens, try to cover more informative categories first
(temporal, logical, pragmatic, global) and avoid generating only trivial factual questions.

Below are precise definitions and decision rules. Do NOT invent extra categories.


1) TEMPORAL ("temporal")
------------------------

What it tests:
- Whether the translation preserves temporal information:
  past vs present vs future, already vs not yet, before vs after,
  and clearly ordered events.

Focus:
- WHEN events happen and how they relate in time:
  - tense (past / present / future),
  - explicit future plans or past experiences,
  - ordering (one event happens before or after another),
  - explicit duration or time frames.

Use this category when:
- The sentence clearly indicates that something has already happened,
  is happening now, or will happen,
- Or when it specifies an order of events (e.g. one thing happens,
  then another, or something happens before another),
- Or when time expressions are used to signal change across time
  (e.g. “now”, “later”, “in the next video”, “today I am going to…”).

DO NOT mark a question as temporal just because there are time words
or names of days/dates if they do not create a meaningful temporal
relation. In that case it is usually FACTUAL.

Temporal questions should focus on:
- whether the event is past/present/future,
- the relative order of events (which happens first/next),
- time frames or durations that are crucial for understanding.


2) LOGICAL RELATIONS ("logical")
--------------------------------

What it tests:
- Whether the translation preserves logical relations:
  causes, conditions, negations, comparisons, contrasts.

Focus:
- WHY something happens, under which CONDITIONS it happens,
  and how statements relate logically (cause → effect, if → then,
  not X, but Y, etc.).

Use this category when the sentence explicitly expresses:
- causal relations (because, so, therefore),
- conditions (if, unless, only if),
- explicit negations (does not, cannot, never),
- explicit contrasts or corrections (but, however, instead of).

Logical questions should test:
- correct identification of cause vs effect,
- presence or absence of a condition,
- recognition of negation or contrast,
- the logical structure encoded in the sentence.


3) PRAGMATIC STRUCTURE ("pragmatic")
------------------------------------

What it tests:
- Whether the translation preserves the communicative intention:
  question vs instruction vs suggestion, certainty vs possibility, etc.

Focus:
- The TYPE of utterance (speech act) and WHY it is being said,
  not just its literal content.

Use this category when the sentence’s speech act is crucial, for example:
- explicit questions,
- instructions / commands,
- suggestions / advice,
- explicit expressions of certainty, doubt, hope, promise, intention.

Pragmatic questions may ask about:
- what the speaker is doing with the sentence (asking / advising / inviting),
- what attitude or intention is expressed (e.g., certainty vs possibility),
- what the speaker plans or promises to do.


4) FACTUAL DETAILS AND CONTENT ("factual")
------------------------------------------

What it tests:
- Whether the translation preserves concrete details and vocabulary:
  objects, locations, properties, quantities, and specific actions.

Focus:
- Concrete, inspectable details and local content:
  WHO / WHAT / WHERE / HOW MANY / WHICH PROPERTIES / WHICH ACTION.

Use this category when the sentence contains specific information about:
- entities (people, objects, animals),
- locations or settings,
- numbers or quantities,
- physical properties (size, color, shape),
- specific actions being performed.

Factual questions should not be trivial YES/NO.
They should require selecting the correct detail among several
alternative details that are all plausible given the sentence.


5) GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING ("global")
-----------------------------------

What it tests:
- Whether the translation preserves the overall purpose or main idea
  of the sentence.

Focus:
- The core meaning of the sentence as a whole.

Use this category to capture:
- who the sentence is “about” and what it says about them,
- what the main event, situation, or purpose is,
- the key message or role described (for example, who someone is,
  what they are going to talk about, or the central claim of the sentence).

Global questions should test whether the reader understands the sentence
as a whole, not just one local detail.


QUESTION REQUIREMENTS
=====================

For each sentence, you MUST output a list called "questions".

Each question must be an object with:
- "category": one of
    "temporal", "logical", "pragmatic", "factual", "global"
- "question": a short, clear question in English.
- "correct_answer": a short, correct answer in English.
- "distractors": an array of EXACTLY 4 incorrect answers in English.

No other fields are required from you.

Number of questions:
- At most 3 questions per sentence.
- At most 1 question per category per sentence.
- For contentful sentences, aim for 1 or 2 questions.
- For very short or phatic sentences, you may output an empty list: "questions": [].


DISTRACTOR DESIGN
==================

The multiple-choice options must really test understanding.

For each question:
- There must be exactly 1 correct answer and 4 distractors.
- ALL 5 options must be:
  * grammatically correct,
  * reasonable in length (short phrases or short sentences),
  * semantically coherent with the sentence.

Distractors MUST:
- Be plausible given the sentence context,
- Reuse similar vocabulary or structure when possible,
- Differ from the correct answer by a specific, meaningful detail,
  such as:
  - different number or quantity,
  - different role or entity (swapped subject/object),
  - different time or order of events,
  - wrong cause, condition, or negation,
  - wrong intention or main idea.

Distractors MUST NOT:
- Be obviously absurd or unrelated to the sentence,
- All be almost identical to each other,
- Contradict basic grammar or world knowledge,
- Be simple negations like “Not X” when X is the correct answer.

Category-specific guidance:
- Temporal questions: distractors should change tense, timing,
  or order of events while staying plausible.
- Logical questions: distractors may invert cause/effect, remove a condition,
  or flip a negation.
- Factual questions: distractors may change numbers, objects, or locations
  in ways that fit the style of the sentence.
- Pragmatic and global questions: distractors may change the speaker’s role,
  intention, or main idea in subtle but incorrect ways.


INPUT FORMAT
============

You will receive a JSON object with a field "sentences" which is a list
of items. Each item has:

- "sentence_id": a string identifier for the sentence
- "source_split": "train", "val", or "test"
- "text": the sentence in English
- "video_id": video identifier string
- "clip_id": clip identifier string

You must treat the sentence text as the ONLY source of truth.
Do not rely on external knowledge beyond what the sentence says.


OUTPUT FORMAT
=============

You MUST answer with a SINGLE valid JSON object with this structure:

- Top level: an object with a single field "sentences".
- "sentences" is a list.
- Each element of "sentences" is an object that:
  - copies exactly "sentence_id", "source_split", "text",
    "video_id" and "clip_id" from the input,
  - adds a field "questions", which is a list of question objects as defined above.

Rules:
- Copy all input fields ("sentence_id", "source_split", "text",
  "video_id", "clip_id") EXACTLY as given.
- "questions" MUST be present for every sentence:
  * use "questions": [] (empty list) only when no meaningful question
    can be generated.
- All questions, correct answers, and distractors must be in English.
- The final answer must be valid JSON, with no extra commentary,
  explanation, or text outside the JSON object.


FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Now process ALL input sentences and return ONLY the JSON object described
above, with no additional text, comments, or explanations.
