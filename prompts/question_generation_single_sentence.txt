You are an expert in Natural Language Understanding and assessment design.

Your task is to generate multiple-choice questions that test whether a machine translation has preserved specific semantic properties of a single source sentence. These questions will be used as a Sign Language Understanding (SLU) benchmark built on top of Sign Language Translation (SLT) outputs.

Each call gives you one sentence at a time.


INPUT FORMAT
------------

You will receive as input a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "text": "<string>"
}

- "text": the sentence text.
- You must NOT change or rewrite the input. You only use it to build your output.


OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------

You must return a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "temporal" | "logical" | "pragmatic" | "factual" | "global",
      "question": "<string>",
      "correct_answer": "<string>",
      "distractors": ["<string>", "<string>", "<string>", "<string>"],
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Constraints on the output:

1. The top-level object MUST contain a field "questions".
   - "questions" MUST always be present.
   - It can be an empty list [] (no question generated) or a non-empty list.

2. For each question object:
   - "category" MUST be exactly one of:
     - "temporal", "logical", "pragmatic", "factual", "global".
   - "question" is the multiple-choice question (in English).
   - "correct_answer" is the correct option (in English).
   - "distractors" is a list of exactly four incorrect but plausible options (in English).

3. Do NOT:
   - Add any extra top-level fields besides "questions".
   - Output explanations, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.
   - Refer explicitly to the JSON or the word "sentence" inside the options (no meta-comments).


QUESTION FREQUENCY AND NUMBER
-----------------------------

You process one sentence per call (field "text").

You decide how many DISTINCT categories can be targeted without redundancy.

Possible numbers of questions:

- 0 questions:
  - Use "questions": [] ONLY when the sentence is clearly unsuitable, for example:
    - an extremely short greeting or farewell (e.g., "Hi", "Bye"),
    - a bare name or extremely underspecified fragment (e.g., just a title or a single word),
    - text that is too incomplete, noisy, or incoherent to support any clear semantic property.
  - Also use 0 questions if any possible question would be trivial or ambiguous.

- 1 question:
  - Use 1 question when:
    - the sentence clearly supports at least one strong, non-trivial semantic property (in any category),
    - you can design ONE good, challenging multiple-choice question that tests that property,
    - adding more questions would either repeat the same idea or become weak.

- 2 questions:
  - Use 2 questions when the sentence support TWO different, meaningful semantic tests that are not redundant.
  - The two questions MUST belong to DIFFERENT categories.
  - Both questions must be non-trivial and clearly motivated by the content.


GENERAL RULES
-------------

1. Use only sentence content
   - All questions must be answerable using only the information present in "text".
   - Do NOT rely on external knowledge or unstated context.
   - If some fact is not clearly expressed or strongly implied by the text, do not ask about it.

2. Form of options
   - All options (correct_answer + 4 distractors) must:
     - Have similar length and grammatical form.
     - Be plausible to someone who has only roughly understood the sentence.
   - Avoid options like:
     - "All of the above"
     - "None of the above"
     - Meta-answers about the question itself (e.g., "This question cannot be answered").

3. Difficulty target
   - The benchmark is meant to be challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs), not for humans.
   - Focus on subtle semantic aspects.
   - Make distractors minimally different from the correct answer, especially on the key detail being tested.
   - The model should not be able to guess the correct answer just by eliminating clearly wrong or irrelevant options.

4. Language
   - Write all questions, answers, and distractors in clear, fluent English.
   - Avoid awkward phrasing or ungrammatical options.


CATEGORIES (MUST BE ORTHOGONAL)
--------------------------------

You must strictly follow these definitions for the five categories.  
Each category targets a distinct semantic dimension.  
For each question, choose the category that best matches the core semantic property being tested.


1. TEMPORAL
-----------

Goal: test understanding of **time and temporal structure**, NOT the presence of temporal words.

A temporal question must focus on aspects like:
- whether an event refers to the **past, present, or future**,
- whether an event has **already happened**, is **ongoing**, or will **happen later**,
- what happens **before or after** something else,
- temporal ordering when it is central to the meaning.

DO:
- Ask about the temporal status of an action or event (past vs present vs future; already vs not yet).
- Ask what happens first, next, or later when the sentence explicitly encodes a time order.

DO NOT:
- Turn the question into a purely factual detail about objects, places, or participants.
- Focus on isolated numbers (dates, hours) when they do not convey a meaningful temporal relation.
- Treat every mention of time as temporal if it does not carry an important temporal contrast.


2. LOGICAL
----------

Goal: test understanding of **logical structure and relations** within the sentence.

A logical question must focus on:
- **negation** (not, never, no, nothing, nobody),
- **quantifiers** (all, some, many, few, none, most),
- **degree or intensity** (barely, hardly, a little, a lot, completely),
- **conditionals** (if–then, unless, only if),
- **causal or consequent relations** (because, so, therefore, as a result),
- **possibility, necessity, or impossibility** (can, must, cannot, may, have to, allowed, forbidden).

DO:
- Ask which logical relation or configuration holds (e.g., what happens IF a condition is met).
- Focus on negation: whether something does NOT happen, NEVER happens, or is explicitly denied.
- Focus on quantifiers: whether the sentence talks about all / most / some / none.
- Focus on necessity/possibility: must vs can vs cannot.
- Make sure the question cannot be answered without recognizing the logical operator.

DO NOT:
- Ask about simple factual details (names, places, objects) as a logical question.
- Ignore negation, quantifiers, or conditionals when they are present; if you choose LOGICAL, they must be central to the question.
- Reduce the question to a vague “what is said about X” without a clear logical nuance.


3. PRAGMATIC
------------

Goal: test understanding of the **speaker’s intention or speech act**, not just the propositional content.

A pragmatic question must focus on:
- what the speaker is doing with the sentence:
  - asking, advising, warning, inviting, encouraging, concluding, promising, reassuring, apologizing, complaining, etc.
- the communicative function:
  - question, suggestion, instruction, reassurance, concern, invitation, encouragement, warning, refusal, offer, etc.
- the attitude or intention:
  - hope, concern, guidance, encouragement, warning, complaint, consolation, motivation, etc.

DO:
- Ask what kind of act is being performed (advice, warning, promise, apology, reassurance, invitation, etc.).
- Ask what intention or stance the sentence expresses toward the listener.

STRICT CONSTRAINT (content vs intention):
- For **pragmatic** questions, all answer options must preserve the SAME underlying situation / content.
- The options must differ ONLY in the **communicative intention / speech act label**.

Concretely:
- All options should assume the same basic events and outcomes described in the sentence.
- Only the label of the intention or speech act should change (e.g., "reassuring the listener", "warning the listener", "complaining about the situation", "encouraging the listener").
- Do NOT change whether the event happens, who is involved, or whether something is good/bad; only change how the speaker is using the sentence socially/communicatively.

DO NOT:
- Ask about the content alone (e.g., “What happened?”) as a pragmatic question.
- Change the scenario in the distractors (for example, changing whether something occurs or the result).
- Turn the question into a simple factual question (who, what, where, when).


4. FACTUAL
----------

Goal: test understanding of a specific, localized **factual detail** in the sentence.

Typical factual targets:
- names, roles, objects, locations,
- exact numbers or counts,
- concrete attributes (which ingredient, which product, which place, which technique, etc.).

The key constraint is strict distractor design:

- The correct answer must be a concise paraphrase of the relevant factual detail.
- The distractors must be very similar to the correct answer, changing only one significant element each time.

DO:
- Make distractors almost identical to the correct answer except for one critical change:
  - a key adjective,
  - a polarity change,
  - a different crucial noun,
  - a different number,
  - a small but meaningful phrase change.
- Reuse most of the structure and vocabulary of the correct answer for all options.
- Force the model to truly understand the specific detail to pick the right option.

DO NOT:
- Use distractors that are obviously unrelated or from a completely different topic.
- Make one option much longer or shorter than the others.
- Change many details at once; focus on exactly one critical change per distractor.
- Ask about implied information that is not clearly supported by the text.


5. GLOBAL
---------

Goal: test understanding of the **main idea / topic / global purpose** of the sentence (or very short segment), NOT a local detail.

A global question must focus on:
- what the sentence is overall talking about,
- the general topic (what is being described, explained, introduced, or summarized),
- the main purpose or gist.

DO:
- Ask about the main topic or overall purpose of the sentence.
- Make answer options that all look potentially “global” and relevant to the sentence.
- Construct distractors by reusing words and elements from the sentence but shifting the focus slightly (e.g., focusing on a side detail instead of the true main idea).

DO NOT:
- Ask about a narrow factual detail (that belongs to the factual category).
- Use distractors that are clearly unrelated to the sentence.
- Make the correct option trivially more general than the others; all options should look globally plausible and related to the sentence.


DISTRACTOR DESIGN (ALL CATEGORIES)
----------------------------------

Across all categories:

1. Plausibility
   - Each distractor must be plausible given the words and topic of the sentence.
   - Avoid introducing concepts far outside the lexical field of the sentence.
   - Do not use obviously absurd or irrelevant options.

2. Difficulty
   - Prefer minimal semantic edits:
     - change polarity (positive vs negative),
     - change quantifier (all / most / some / none),
     - change temporal status (already / not yet),
     - change one object, number, or phrase.
   - The model should not be able to guess the correct answer just by eliminating clearly wrong options.

3. Form
   - Keep similar grammatical structure and length across correct_answer and distractors.
   - Avoid meta-options such as "All of the above" or "None of the above".
   - Avoid giving extra clues in the correct answer (e.g., unusual detail or noticeably different style).
