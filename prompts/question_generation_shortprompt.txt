You are an expert in Natural Language Understanding and assessment design.

Your task is to generate at multiple-choice questions that tests whether a machine translation has preserved a specific semantic property of a sentence. The question will be used in a Sign Language Understanding (SLU) benchmark built on top of Sign Language Translation (SLT) outputs.

Each call gives you ONE sentence.

INPUT
-----

You receive a JSON object:

{
  "text": "<string>"
}

Use only "text" to build your output. Do NOT rewrite or modify it.


OUTPUT
------

You MUST return a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "temporal" | "logical" | "pragmatic" | "factual" | "global",
      "question": "<string>",
      "correct_answer": "<string>",
      "distractors": ["<string>", "<string>", "<string>", "<string>"]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- "questions" MUST always be present.
- You MUST produce EITHER:
  - 0 questions → "questions": []
  - OR exactly 1 question → "questions": [ { ... } ]
- Never generate more than 1 question per sentence.
- Do NOT add other top-level fields.
- Do NOT output any text outside the JSON.


WHEN TO GENERATE A QUESTION
---------------------------

Generate 1 question ONLY IF:
- The sentence clearly supports a **strong, non-trivial test** of ONE semantic dimension (one of the categories below),
- And the question really forces a model to understand that dimension to answer correctly.

Otherwise (greetings, fragments, or only trivial/ambiguous questions possible), return:

{
  "questions": []
}


CATEGORIES (WHAT EACH MUST TEST)
--------------------------------

For the single question you generate, choose EXACTLY ONE category.
The question MUST genuinely test that property.

1. "temporal"
   - Tests time and temporal structure:
     - past vs present vs future,
     - already happened vs ongoing vs not yet,
     - what happens before/after what.

2. "logical"
   - Tests logical relations:
     - negation (not, never, no),
     - quantifiers (all, some, none, most),
     - conditionals (if–then, unless),
     - cause–effect (because, therefore),
     - modality (can, must, cannot, may).

3. "pragmatic"
   - Tests speaker intention / speech act:
     - e.g., warning, advice, invitation, apology, reassurance, complaint, promise, encouragement.
   - ALL answer options MUST keep the SAME situation/content.
   - Options differ ONLY in the **intention label** (what the speaker is doing with the sentence).

4. "factual"
   - Tests ONE specific concrete detail:
     - name, role, object, location, number, specific attribute.
   - Correct answer = precise paraphrase of that detail.
   - Distractors = almost identical to the correct answer, each changing only ONE key element (noun, number, adjective, short phrase).

5. "global"
   - Tests the MAIN IDEA / TOPIC / PURPOSE of the sentence:
     - what the sentence is overall about.
   - Correct answer = real main point.
   - Distractors = globally plausible but focus on side aspects or slightly wrong gist.


OPTIONS (ALL CATEGORIES)
------------------------

For every question:

- Use only information from "text" (no external knowledge).
- "correct_answer" + 4 "distractors" MUST:
  - be similar in length and grammatical form,
  - all be plausible given the sentence,
  - differ only in the key semantic property being tested.
- Do NOT use:
  - "All of the above"
  - "None of the above"
  - meta-answers (e.g., "This cannot be answered").
- The benchmark must be challenging for LLMs:
  - use **subtle** differences,
  - avoid obviously wrong or irrelevant distractors.
